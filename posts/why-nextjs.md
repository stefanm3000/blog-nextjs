Next.js is clever enough to only load the Javascript and CSS that are needed for any given page. This makes for much faster page loading times, as a user’s browser doesn't have to download Javascript and CSS that it doesn't need for the specific page the user is viewing. This increases performance as there is less for the user’s browser to download and the user benefits from seeing the page content quicker.
