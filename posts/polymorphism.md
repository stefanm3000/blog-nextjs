Polymorphism is the ability to take on multiple forms.

**There are three kinds of Polymorphism in programming: **

- Adhoc Polymorphism
  Adhoc Polymorphism means to change something from one form to another on the spot.

- Parametric Polymorphism
  Parametric Polymorphism is polymorphism related to parameters.

  Parametric Polymorphism has two parts:

  - Data that can contain many types of data (objects, arrays)
  - Functions that can work with many types of data (.map)

- Subtype Polymorphism
  Subtype Polymorphism involves creating derivative objects from a parent object.
