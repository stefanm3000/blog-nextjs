title: "RWD, mobile or desktop first?"

I know that it's one of the oldest rules in web-dev to go mobile first, but in my opinion, it depends. First we need to consider the analytics of the app in question. What percentage of users are coming from mobile, and desktop? If more than 80% of your users come from desktop, does it make much sense to force yourself to go mobile first? Also, in my experience, with flexbox and grid its become much easier to simply make everything (or 90%) of your app be responsive anyway, so the dev experience is much better to go desktop first and then tweak the final 10%. Again, this is just my opinion and I could be wrong.
